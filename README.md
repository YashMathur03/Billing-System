# Billing-System
Turbo CPP - Electricity Billing System
Electricity Billing system is specially designed
for the purpose of calculating the total
electricity bill . In this system, an agent has to
enter the total units consumed by the
consumer and the database gets created. This
data is stored in the program. When the
consumer logs in the program using the
unique customer id, the summary of the bill is
generated and customer gets options for
paying the bill .The user is provided with
different modes of payment for paying the
dues. The whole project is designed in ‘C++’
language and different variables and strings
have been used for the development of this
project. It’s easy to operate and understand by
users. There are no errors in the program and
it is designed so that the user won’t find it
difficult to use and navigate.
The old manual system was suffering from a
series of drawbacks. Since whole of the
system was to be maintained with the hands,
the process of keeping, maintaining and
retrieving the information was very tedious
and lengthy. The records were never used to
be in a systematic order. There used to be lots
of difficulties in associating any particular
transaction with a particular content. If any
information was to be found, it was required
to go through different registers and
documents. There would always be
unnecessary consumption of time while
entering records and checking errors in it. For
this reason I have provided a computerised
system to do all the calculations, report
generations as well as payment.


1.Turbo C++ 3.2
Header files included:
 iostream.h – for i/o facilities
 conio.h –for using getch(), clrscr()
 string.h – for strlen(),strcmp(),strcmpi()
 dos.h- for delay()
 stdlib.h- for exit(0)
 fstream.h- for binary file
I have used arrays, functions, iteration
statements, classes, strings, binary file
handling in my project.
